# LQR-Pybricks-Turning

A Python project for controlling a Pybricks-based robot with turning behavior driven by an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) control strategy.

## Overview

This repository is intended for experiments and implementations involving:

- Pybricks robot control
- Robot turning and motion regulation
- LQR-based feedback control
- LEGO Mindstorms / Pybricks development workflows

The code in this project can be adapted for testing control logic, tuning movement behavior, and developing autonomous robot turning routines.

## Project goals

- Model and control robot turning dynamics
- Use feedback control to improve motion stability
- Implement reusable motion functions in Python
- Run experiments on a Pybricks-enabled robot platform

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.9+
- Pybricks installed
- A compatible LEGO Mindstorms robot hub supported by Pybricks
- A development environment such as VS Code, PyCharm, or a terminal session

Install Pybricks:

```bash
pip install pybricks
```

If this repository is still being developed, you may add or rename folders as your implementation grows.

## Typical usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xngu333/LQR-Pybricks-Turning.git
cd LQR-Pybricks-Turning
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Python code for your robot control logic:

```bash
python main.py
```

Adjust the entry point to match the actual file names in your project.

## LQR control notes

This project is designed around a state-space feedback controller. In a typical implementation, the robot states may include:

- heading angle
- angular velocity
- position error
- steering response

The controller aims to minimize deviations from the desired motion while keeping the system stable and responsive.

## Development suggestions

- Add a `requirements.txt` for project dependencies
- Organize robot logic into modules such as `control.py`, `motion.py`, and `robot.py`
- Document tuning parameters for LQR matrices and gains
- Add tests for turning angle accuracy and stability

## License

This project does not currently include a license file. If you plan to share or distribute the project publicly, consider adding an appropriate open-source license such as MIT or Apache 2.0.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you want to expand this project:

- improve the robot motion model
- tune the controller gains
- add more autonomous movement routines
- improve documentation and examples
